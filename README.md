# Liars Dice Websocket Server Client Game

Liar's Dice is a Client Server game made using Python's Websockets 
This was created for my CS Networking class while I was attending University.  
I am in the process of refactoring/cleaning both the client and server code.  

The npcVersionGame.py file is a version of the game that doesn't use websockets, 
but instead has simple NPC players for opponents.

##  How To Run:
#### Client/Server
run server and clients in seperate terminals.  

    python LDGameServer.py
    python LDGameClient.py

#### NPC Version
    python npcVersionGame.py
