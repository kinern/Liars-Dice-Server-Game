# Liars Dice Websocket Server Client Game

Liar's Dice is a Client Server game made using Python's Websockets. 
This was created for my CS Networking class while I was attending University.  
It has been updated to use the Asyncio library for handling multiple clients.

The LDWithoutSockets.py file is a version of the game that doesn't have multiple clients, 
but instead uses simple NPC players for opponents.

##  How To Run:
#### Client/Server
run server and clients in seperate terminals.  

    # python LDGameServer.py
    # python LDGameClient.py

#### NPC Version
    # python LDWithoutSockets.py
